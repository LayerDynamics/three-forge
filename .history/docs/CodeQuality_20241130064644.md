### **Code Quality Standards for the Game Engine**

To ensure that Three-Forgee is maintainable, scalable, and performant, we will define and enforce the following **code quality standards**. These standards will guide every aspect of the development process, from writing individual components to designing complex systems.

---

### **1. General Principles**

#### **Consistency**
- All code should follow a consistent coding style, naming conventions, and file structure across the project.
- Use **Prettier** for code formatting and **ESLint** for linting to enforce consistency.

#### **Readability**
- Code must be **self-documenting**, with clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write concise but informative comments where necessary to explain complex logic or unusual decisions.

#### **Reusability**
- Prefer modular, reusable components, and systems.
- Avoid duplication by abstracting shared logic into utilities or hooks.

#### **Performance**
- Ensure systems and components are optimized for real-time performance, especially in the game loop.
- Use React optimizations (e.g., `useMemo`, `useCallback`) and selective state updates (e.g., Zustand selectors).

#### **Error Handling**
- Include proper error handling and fallback mechanisms in all systems and components.
- Log errors with enough detail to identify the root cause while avoiding sensitive information leaks.

#### **Testing**
- Write tests for critical systems, ensuring proper integration and functionality.
- Use **unit tests** for isolated logic and **integration tests** for interactions between systems.

### **2. Coding Standards**

#### **2.1 Naming Conventions**
- **Files**:
  - System files: `SystemNameSystem.ts` (e.g., `AbilitySystem.ts`).
  - Hook files: `useSystemName.ts` (e.g., `useAbility.ts`).
  - Type files: `systemName.types.ts` (e.g., `ability.types.ts`).
- **Variables and Functions**:
  - Use `camelCase` for variables and function names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names.
  - Prefix private variables/methods with `_`.

Examples:
```typescript
// Good
class AbilitySystem {
  private _cooldowns: Map<string, number>;
  public useAbility(id: string): void { /* ... */ }
}

// Bad
class abilitysystem {
  cooldowns: any; // No type, inconsistent naming
  UseAbility(Id: string): void { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

#### **2.2 Type Safety**
- Use **TypeScript** for all code to enforce type safety.
- Define comprehensive types/interfaces for all systems, hooks, and components.
- Use generics for reusable logic.

Examples:
```typescript
// Good
export interface Ability {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  cooldown: number;
  activate: () => void;
}

// Bad
export type Ability = any; // Lacks clarity and validation
```

---

#### **2.3 Code Structure**
- **Single Responsibility**:
  - Each function, class, or file should have a clear and singular purpose.
- **File Organization**:
  - Group related files together (e.g., systems, hooks, types).
  - Keep files small and focused; avoid large, monolithic files.

Examples:
```plaintext
src/
├── systems/
│   ├── AbilitySystem.ts
│   ├── WeaponSystem.ts
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAbility.ts
│   ├── useWeapon.ts
└── types/
    ├── ability.types.ts
    ├── weapon.types.ts
```

---

#### **2.4 Error Handling**
- Use `try-catch` blocks to handle potential failures gracefully.
- Centralize error reporting where possible, using a logging utility.

Examples:
```typescript
// Good
try {
  system.performAction(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error performing action:", error);
}

// Bad
system.performAction(data); // No error handling
```

---

#### **2.5 Comments and Documentation**
- Use **JSDoc** for all public methods, functions, and complex logic.
- Add inline comments only when the purpose of the code is not immediately clear.

Examples:
```typescript
/**
 * Activates an ability by ID.
 * @param id - The ID of the ability to activate.
 */
public useAbility(id: string): void {
  // Check if ability exists
  const ability = this.store.getState().abilities[id];
  if (!ability) {
    throw new Error(`Ability with ID ${id} does not exist`);
  }
  ability.activate();
}
```

---

### **3. Performance Standards**

#### **3.1 Minimize Re-Renders**
- Use React optimizations to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to memoize expensive computations and stable references.

Examples:
```typescript
const filteredAbilities = useMemo(() => {
  return abilities.filter((a) => a.isAvailable);
}, [abilities]);
```

#### **3.2 Optimize State Updates**
- Use Zustand selectors to limit reactivity to relevant state changes.
- Avoid deeply nested state structures to minimize complexity.

Examples:
```typescript
const { health } = useStore(playerStore, (state) => ({ health: state.health }));
```

---

#### **3.3 Reduce Game Loop Overhead**
- Ensure systems registered in the game loop (`update(deltaTime)`) are lightweight and optimized.
- Avoid performing expensive operations (e.g., I/O) directly in the game loop.

---

### **4. Testing Standards**

#### **4.1 Unit Testing**
- Test isolated logic, such as utility functions and methods, using **Jest**.
- Cover edge cases and expected failures.

#### **4.2 Integration Testing**
- Test the interaction between systems (e.g., `AbilitySystem` and `WeaponSystem`) using **React Testing Library** or integration tools.

#### **4.3 Performance Testing**
- Profile game performance to ensure consistent frame rates.
- Use tools like `r3f-perf` for React Three Fiber-specific performance profiling.
