= SPEC-1: React-Three/Fiber-Based Game Engine
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

The popularity of modern 3D game development has grown significantly with the rise of WebGL and JavaScript frameworks. Among these, `react-three/fiber` offers an efficient, declarative abstraction over Three.js, enabling React developers to build 3D scenes with ease.

However, existing solutions like Three.js or Unity WebGL often focus on either specific use cases or lack flexibility for generalized requirements. This project aims to build a fully featured, React-based 3D game engine leveraging `react-three/fiber`. This engine will streamline the development of 3D games by integrating essential features such as:

- A robust scene graph manager for object hierarchies.
- Physics simulation for realistic interactions.
- An animation system for character rigs and transitions.
- Asset loading for textures, 3D models, and environments.
- Multiplayer-ready architecture for future real-time experiences.
- UI integration for blending 2D and 3D interfaces.
- A logic engine to handle game mechanics and event-driven systems.
- Progression systems (e.g., XP, abilities, weapons) to enhance gameplay.

The engine is intended to be general-purpose, supporting a variety of game genres while maintaining extensibility for custom features.

== Method

The game engine is built on the foundation of `react-three/fiber`, leveraging its declarative syntax and compatibility with React for seamless 3D development. It integrates additional tools and libraries to address core game engine requirements.

=== Architectural Overview

The engine follows a modular architecture, with components organized into distinct layers for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility:

1. **Rendering Layer**
   - Uses `react-three/fiber` for declarative 3D scene rendering.
   - Integrates `@react-three/drei` for commonly used 3D utilities and components.
   - Supports advanced visual effects through `postprocessing`.

2. **Scene Management Layer**
   - Provides a scene graph manager to manage object hierarchies, transformations, and state efficiently.
   - Allows serialization and deserialization of scenes for saving/loading.

3. **Physics Layer**
   - Leverages `use-cannon` (Cannon.js bindings for React) for collision detection, rigid body physics, and dynamic interactions.
   - Supports real-time updates between the physics world and rendered objects using hooks.

4. **Animation Layer**
   - Uses `react-spring` and `@react-three/drei` for simple animations.
   - Enables skeletal animation and blend spaces for character rigs through `react-three/fiber` animation capabilities.

5. **Asset Management Layer**
   - Handles loading of models, textures, materials, and shaders using `@react-three/drei` loaders.
   - Includes a caching mechanism to minimize redundant asset loading.

6. **Logic and Event System**
   - Implements an event-driven system for handling user inputs, scene changes, and game state.
   - Provides hooks for developers to define custom behaviors and mechanics.

7. **Progression Systems**
   - Tracks player XP, level-ups, and unlockable abilities using `XpSystem` and `AbilitySystem`.
   - Includes weapon management with destruction logic and upgrades using `WeaponSystem`.

8. **UI Integration Layer**
   - Enables 2D UI overlays using traditional React components.
   - Supports in-world 3D UI elements with `react-three-fiber`.
