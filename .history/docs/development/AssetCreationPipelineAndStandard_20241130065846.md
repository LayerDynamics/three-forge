### **Asset Creation Standards and Pipeline**

A robust and efficient **asset creation pipeline** is critical for delivering performant, visually appealing, and scalable game experiences. This pipeline defines the standards for creating, optimizing, and integrating assets such as 3D models, textures, audio, and shaders into the game engine.

---

### **1. General Asset Creation Standards**

#### **1.1 File Formats**
To ensure compatibility, performance, and ease of use, we will standardize on the following formats:

| **Asset Type**       | **Formats**         | **Reason**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **3D Models**         | `.glb`, `.gltf`    | Compact, efficient, and widely supported by Three.js and modern pipelines. |
| **Textures**          | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp` | `.png` for lossless quality, `.jpg` for smaller sizes, `.webp` for modern compression. |
| **Audio**             | `.mp3`, `.wav`     | `.mp3` for compressed audio, `.wav` for uncompressed high-quality sound.   |
| **Shaders**           | `.glsl`            | Standard format for custom vertex and fragment shaders.                    |
| **Animations**        | Embedded in `.glb` | Ensures tight integration of models and animations in a single file.       |

---

#### **1.2 Naming Conventions**
Assets must follow a clear and consistent naming convention to ensure easy identification and organization:
- **Structure**: `[type]_[category]_[descriptor].[format]`
- **Examples**:
  - `model_character_knight.glb`
  - `texture_environment_skybox.jpg`
  - `audio_effect_explosion.mp3`
  - `shader_water_reflection.glsl`

---

#### **1.3 Optimization Standards**

| **Asset Type**       | **Optimization Guidelines**                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **3D Models**         | Reduce polygon count to a reasonable level (<50k per object for gameplay-critical assets).                       |
|                       | Use LOD (Level of Detail) for high-performance scenes.                                                           |
|                       | Compress models using Draco or Meshopt to reduce file sizes.                                                     |
| **Textures**          | Compress images using tools like TinyPNG or ImageMagick.                                                         |
|                       | Generate mipmaps to reduce GPU memory usage for distant objects.                                                 |
| **Audio**             | Normalize sound levels and use 44.1kHz sampling for most assets.                                                 |
|                       | Loopable sounds (e.g., ambient music) must have precise start and end points.                                    |
| **Shaders**           | Optimize GLSL code by reducing branching and minimizing uniform variables.                                       |

### **2. Asset Creation Pipeline**

The asset pipeline standardizes the process from asset creation to integration into the game engine. This ensures all assets meet performance and quality requirements.

---

#### **2.1 Step 1: Asset Design**
- **Description**: Artists and designers create raw assets using 3D modeling, texture creation, or audio production tools.
- **Tools**:
  - **3D Models**: Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max.
  - **Textures**: Photoshop, GIMP, Substance Painter.
  - **Audio**: Audacity, Adobe Audition.
  - **Shaders**: GLSL editors or integrated IDE tools.
- **Standards**:
  - Models are created with clean topology and minimal overlapping UVs.
  - Textures are authored at a resolution suitable for their usage (e.g., 2048x2048 for character textures, 512x512 for small props).
  - Audio clips are normalized and tested for clarity.

---

#### **2.2 Step 2: Asset Optimization**
- **Description**: Raw assets are processed and optimized to meet performance requirements.
- **Tools**:
  - **3D Models**: Blender for decimation and cleanup, Draco or Meshopt for compression.
  - **Textures**: TinyPNG, ImageMagick, or Substance Designer for compression and mipmap generation.
  - **Audio**: Audacity for file format conversion and loop point editing.
- **Standards**:
  - **LOD (Level of Detail)**:
    - For complex models, create multiple LODs (e.g., high, medium, low) and export as a single `.gltf` or `.glb` file.
  - **Texture Compression**:
    - Save diffuse, normal, and specular maps separately.
    - Use `.webp` for environments, `.png` for UI elements, and `.jpg` for non-essential assets.

---

#### **2.3 Step 3: Asset Validation**
- **Description**: Validate the integrity and performance of the assets before integration.
- **Tools**:
  - **Three.js Validators**: Validate `.gltf` or `.glb` models.
  - **Texture Validators**: Tools to check texture dimensions and formats.
  - **Audio Validators**: Ensure loop points are precise and file sizes are within limits.
- **Validation Checklist**:
  - All 3D models are free of non-manifold geometry and overlapping UVs.
  - Textures are in power-of-two resolutions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) for optimal GPU performance.
  - Audio files are tested for clarity and playback consistency.

---

#### **2.4 Step 4: Asset Integration**
- **Description**: Assets are added to the game engine, linked to systems (e.g., `AssetLoaderSystem`), and made accessible to components.
- **Tools**:
  - Asset management systems (e.g., `AssetLoaderSystem`).
  - **@react-three/drei** for handling asset imports in R3F.
- **Process**:
  - Assets are placed in the `src/assets/processed/` folder.
  - Models are preloaded and cached for faster runtime loading.
  - Textures are assigned to appropriate materials in shaders or PBR workflows.

---

#### **2.5 Step 5: Runtime Testing**
- **Description**: Test assets in the context of the game to ensure visual quality, performance, and compatibility.
- **Tools**:
  - React Three Fiber application for live testing.
  - **r3f-perf** to monitor FPS and memory usage.
  - Chrome DevTools to analyze asset loading and rendering.
- **Checklist**:
  - Ensure all models are correctly positioned, scaled, and textured in the scene.
  - Verify that assets do not significantly impact frame rate.
  - Validate that all textures and shaders load without errors.

---

### **3. Asset Folder Structure**

The project folder for assets will be organized as follows:
```plaintext
src/
├── assets/
│   ├── raw/                      # Raw assets from designers and artists.
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── textures/
│   │   ├── audio/
│   │   └── shaders/
│   ├── processed/                # Optimized assets ready for integration.
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── textures/
│   │   ├── audio/
│   │   └── shaders/
│   └── references/               # Reference images, mockups, and designs.
```

---

### **4. Automation Tools and Scripts**

To streamline the asset pipeline, we will implement automation for optimization and validation:

#### **4.1 Asset Optimization Script**
- **Tool**: Node.js + external libraries (e.g., `glTF-Transform`, `sharp` for image processing).
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const { transform } = require('@gltf-transform/core');
  const { draco } = require('@gltf-transform/extensions');

  async function optimizeModel(inputPath, outputPath) {
    const doc = await transform(inputPath, [draco()]);
    await doc.write(outputPath);
  }
  ```

#### **4.2 Asset Preloading**
- **Tool**: `@react-three/drei` for asset loading and caching.
- **Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { useGLTF, useTexture } from "@react-three/drei";

  function Scene() {
    const model = useGLTF("/assets/processed/models/character.glb");
    const texture = useTexture("/assets/processed/textures/diffuse.png");

    return <primitive object={model.scene} material={texture} />;
  }
  ```
