### **Performance Profiling Standards**

To ensure that the game engine meets high performance requirements, especially for real-time gameplay, we will define **performance profiling standards**. These standards will guide developers in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing systems, and maintaining consistent performance.

### **1. Key Performance Metrics**

The following metrics are critical for measuring the performance of the game engine:

| **Metric**               | **Definition**                                                                                      | **Target**                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Frame Rate (FPS)**      | Frames rendered per second.                                                                        | 60 FPS minimum on target devices. |
| **Frame Time**            | Time (in ms) taken to render a single frame.                                                       | 16.67ms or less for 60 FPS.   |
| **Memory Usage**          | Total memory consumed by the engine (including assets, systems, and runtime).                      | Under 500MB for browser-based games. |
| **CPU Usage**             | Percentage of CPU utilization during gameplay.                                                     | Under 60% during normal gameplay. |
| **GPU Usage**             | Percentage of GPU utilization during rendering.                                                    | Under 80% on target hardware. |
| **Load Times**            | Time taken to load assets, initialize scenes, and display the first playable frame.                | Less than 3 seconds.          |
| **Draw Calls**            | Number of draw calls issued per frame.                                                             | Under 150 for complex scenes. |
| **Object Count**          | Number of 3D objects in the scene.                                                                 | Optimized to minimize excess. |
| **Poly Count**            | Total number of polygons rendered per frame.                                                      | Under 1M for real-time scenes. |

  - Integrate during development and debug builds.
- **Code Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { Perf } from "r3f-perf";

  function DebugPerf() {
    return <Perf position="top-left" />;
  }

  <Canvas>
    <DebugPerf />
    {/* Other components */}
  </Canvas>
  ```

#### **2.2 Chrome DevTools**
- **Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive profiling suite for measuring load times, memory usage, and rendering performance.
- **Usage**:
  - Use the **Performance Tab** to record frame timings, rendering stats, and event timings.
  - Use the **Memory Tab** to detect memory leaks or excessive allocation.

#### **2.3 React Profiler**
- **Purpose**: Measures React component rendering times and identifies unnecessary re-renders.
- **Usage**:
  - Use the built-in React Developer Tools.
  - Record a session and analyze component render times.

#### **2.4 WebGL Inspector**
- **Purpose**: Debug and profile WebGL render pipelines.
- **Features**:
  - Inspects draw calls, textures, shaders, and framebuffers.
  - Useful for diagnosing bottlenecks in rendering.

#### **2.5 Lighthouse**
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the overall performance of web-based games, including load times and runtime performance.
- **Usage**:
  - Run an audit in Chrome DevTools to identify slow-loading assets or rendering issues.

#### **2.6 GPU Profiler Tools**
- **Tools**:
  - NVIDIA Nsight for GPU profiling on NVIDIA hardware.
  - AMD Radeon GPU Profiler for AMD-specific optimizations.
- **Purpose**: Provides low-level insights into GPU utilization, bottlenecks, and shader performance.

### **3. Profiling Workflow**

#### **3.1 Frame Rate and Frame Time**
1. **Setup**:
   - Use `r3f-perf` to monitor FPS and frame time during gameplay.
   - Record frame time spikes (>16.67ms) for optimization.
2. **Common Bottlenecks**:
   - Excessive draw calls.
   - Heavy use of post-processing effects.
   - Complex animations or physics calculations in the main thread.
3. **Solutions**:
   - Use instancing for repeated objects.
   - Reduce or optimize post-processing effects.
   - Move expensive computations to Web Workers or a physics engine like `@react-three/cannon`.

#### **3.2 Memory Profiling**
1. **Setup**:
   - Use Chrome DevTools’ **Memory Tab** or `r3f-perf`.
2. **Common Issues**:
   - Memory leaks from event listeners or unmounted components.
   - Large unoptimized textures or models.
3. **Solutions**:
   - Ensure cleanup of event listeners and subscriptions.
   - Compress textures and limit resolution for in-game assets.

#### **3.3 GPU Profiling**
1. **Setup**:
   - Use WebGL Inspector or GPU-specific tools.
2. **Common Issues**:
   - Excessive shader complexity.
   - Overdraw from overlapping transparent objects.
3. **Solutions**:
   - Simplify shaders or use pre-baked effects.
   - Minimize transparent object overlap and use alpha testing where possible.

#### **3.4 Load Time Profiling**
1. **Setup**:
   - Use Lighthouse to measure asset load times.
2. **Common Issues**:
   - Large, uncompressed assets.
   - Inefficient asset preloading strategy.
3. **Solutions**:
   - Use asset compression (e.g., Draco for models, TinyPNG for textures).
   - Lazy load non-critical assets.

### **4. Optimization Targets**

#### **Scene Optimization**
- **Draw Calls**: Use instancing for repeated objects.
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Use LOD meshes for distant objects.
- **Culling**: Enable frustum culling and occlusion culling.

#### **Asset Optimization**
- **Textures**:
  - Compress using modern formats like `.webp`.
  - Generate mipmaps to reduce memory usage on smaller scales.
- **3D Models**:
  - Use Draco or Meshopt to reduce file sizes.
  - Limit polygon count to only what's necessary.

#### **System-Specific Optimization**
- **Physics System**:
  - Use broad-phase collision detection.
  - Limit the number of active dynamic objects.
- **Animation System**:
  - Use baked animations where possible.
  - Limit the number of active skeletal rigs.

---

### **5. Performance Testing Standards**

#### **5.1 Automated Performance Testing**
- Use **Jest Performance Hooks** or custom scripts to measure runtime performance of critical systems.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  test("Physics system handles 1000 objects under 16ms", () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    runPhysicsSimulation(1000); // Simulates 1000 objects
    const end = performance.now();
    expect(end - start).toBeLessThan(16);
  });
  ```

#### **5.2 Regression Testing**
- Create baseline performance benchmarks (e.g., FPS, memory usage).
- Run automated tests to ensure changes don’t degrade performance.

#### **5.3 Manual Testing**
- Regularly test the engine on target hardware, including low-spec devices.
- Use tools like `r3f-perf` and Chrome DevTools to identify bottlenecks.
