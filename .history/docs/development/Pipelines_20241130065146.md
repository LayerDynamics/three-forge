### **Defining QA and Testing Development Tools**

To ensure the game engine is robust, performant, and bug-free, we will integrate **QA and testing tools** specifically tailored for React Three Fiber (R3F) and game development.

---

#### **1. QA and Testing Development Tools**

##### **1.1 r3f-perf**
- **Purpose**: Monitor performance metrics specific to React Three Fiber (R3F) applications.
- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks FPS, GPU usage, and memory consumption in real-time.
  - Visualizes React and Three.js component rendering performance.
- **Usage**:
  - Installed as a development-only dependency and rendered conditionally in debug mode.
- **Integration Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { Perf } from "r3f-perf";

  function DebugUI() {
    return process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? <Perf /> : null;
  }

  <Canvas>
    <DebugUI />
    {/* Other components */}
  </Canvas>
  ```

---

##### **1.2 ARc Developer Tools**
- **Purpose**: Debug, inspect, and manage R3F applications.
- **Key Features**:
  - Displays the R3F scene hierarchy for easy debugging.
  - Allows inspection of object properties (position, rotation, scale).
  - Supports live editing of Three.js objects.
- **Usage**:
  - Works as a browser extension integrated during development.
- **Setup**:
  - Ensure the application uses React DevTools to enable deeper debugging.

---

##### **1.3 React Testing Library**
- **Purpose**: Write unit and integration tests for React components and hooks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simulates user interactions to verify UI behavior.
  - Supports testing hooks (e.g., custom hooks for systems).
- **Usage Example**:
  ```tsx
  import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
  import { useWeapon } from "../hooks/useWeapon";

  test("fires the equipped weapon", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useWeapon());
    act(() => result.current.fireWeapon());
    expect(result.current.weaponState.lastFired).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
  ```

---

##### **1.4 Cypress**
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing of user workflows.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automates user interactions with the game to validate functionality.
  - Simulates input events like keyboard presses and mouse clicks.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```javascript
  describe("Gameplay Tests", () => {
    it("should equip and fire a weapon", () => {
      cy.visit("/game");
      cy.get("[data-testid='equip-weapon']").click();
      cy.get("[data-testid='fire-weapon']").click();
      cy.contains("Weapon Fired").should("exist");
    });
  });
  ```

---

##### **1.5 DevTools and Profiling**
- **Chrome DevTools**:
  - Used to measure load times, memory usage, and render performance.
  - Network tab helps monitor asset loading and caching behavior.
- **React Profiler**:
  - Measures React component rendering performance.
  - Identifies unnecessary re-renders and helps optimize hooks.

### **Defining the Development Pipeline**

To maintain a clean and efficient development process, we define the following workflows:

---

#### **1. Git Workflow**
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - Use **GitFlow** or a simplified branching model:
    - `main`: Production-ready code.
    - `dev`: Active development branch.
    - `feature/<feature-name>`: Branch for specific features.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
  - Every feature branch must merge into `dev` via a PR.
  - PR checks:
    - Linting (via ESLint/Prettier).
    - Automated testing (unit and integration).
    - Code review (2 approvals required).
- **Release Process**:
  - Use **semantic versioning**:
    - `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`).
  - Tag each release with a version and change log.

---

#### **2. Documentation Workflow**
- **Tools**:
  - **Storybook** for component and hook documentation.
  - **Docusaurus** for system-level and API documentation.
- **Process**:
  - Developers update documentation during feature development.
  - PRs must include updated documentation where applicable.
- **Deployment**:
  - Use GitHub Pages or Netlify to host live documentation.

---

#### **3. Testing Workflow and Standards**
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Focus on isolated logic (e.g., hooks, system methods).
  - Write tests for edge cases and expected failures.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test interactions between systems (e.g., `AbilitySystem` and `WeaponSystem`).
- **E2E Tests**:
  - Automate gameplay scenarios (e.g., equip weapon, fire, reload).
- **Coverage Standards**:
  - Minimum of 80% test coverage for core systems.

### **Defining the Asset Pipeline**

To ensure efficient handling of game assets, we define the supported formats, optimization practices, and workflows.

---

#### **1. Supported File Formats**

| **Asset Type** | **Formats**           | **Reasons for Selection**                                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **3D Models**  | `.glb`, `.gltf`       | Compact, efficient, and widely supported in Three.js. `.glb` is binary; `.gltf` is JSON for easier edits. |
| **Textures**   | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp` | `.png` for lossless quality, `.jpg` for smaller file sizes, `.webp` for modern web optimizations.         |
| **Audio**      | `.mp3`, `.wav`        | `.mp3` for compressed audio, `.wav` for high-quality uncompressed audio.                                 |
| **Shaders**    | `.glsl`               | Standard for defining vertex and fragment shaders.                                                       |

---

#### **2. Asset Optimization**

- **3D Models**:
  - Compress models using Draco or Meshopt to reduce file size.
  - Limit the polygon count for models used in real-time rendering.
- **Textures**:
  - Generate mipmaps for better rendering performance.
  - Optimize textures using tools like **ImageMagick** or **TinyPNG**.
- **Audio**:
  - Normalize audio levels.
  - Use shorter loops and compress where possible.

---

#### **3. Asset Workflow**

1. **Importing**:
   - Place raw assets in `src/assets/raw/`.
2. **Processing**:
   - Use scripts to optimize and compress assets.
   - Processed assets are moved to `src/assets/processed/`.
3. **Loading**:
   - Load assets dynamically using `@react-three/drei` or `AssetLoaderSystem`.
4. **Validation**:
   - Use automated checks to ensure asset sizes and formats meet standards.

---

#### **4. Naming Conventions**
- Use consistent, descriptive names:
  - `character_hero.glb`, `background_skybox.png`, `weapon_laser.wav`.

---

#### **5. Version Control**
- Use version control to manage changes and track asset history.
- Use **Git** for version control.

---

#### **6. Documentation**
- Use **Storybook** for component and hook documentation.
- Use **Docusaurus** for system-level and API documentation.
